# quarkus-project7-hibernate-orm-panache-entity
 A Sample Java Microservice Project built with Quarkus demonstrating  Hibernate ORM PanacheEntity and JPA with PostgreSQL using the active record pattern.

To define a Panache entity, simply extend PanacheEntity, annotate it with @Entity and add your columns as public fields.You can put all your JPA column annotations on the public fields. If you need a field to not be persisted, use the @Transient annotation on it.

Add custom queries on your entities inside the entities themselves. That way, you and your co-workers can find them easily, and queries are co-located with the object they operate on. Adding them as static methods in your entity class is the Panache Active Record way.
 
# Docker Postgresql

docker run --name my_db -e POSTGRES_USER=username -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=my_db -p 5432:5432 postgres:10.5
